I joined as a Junior Research Fellow in the SQC & OR Division of the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata on 17th July 2019.  I have four publications in international journals till today. I have submitted my Ph.D. thesis in Quality, Reliability, and Operations Research (QROR) at ISI. Before joining ISI as a research scholar, I worked as a Junior Research fellow in M.D. University, Rohtak in the Research Project titled "Study of Quantile Based Information Theoretic Measures on Order and Record Statistics" funded by SERB-DST. I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics in 2018 at the Central University of Haryana, India.
